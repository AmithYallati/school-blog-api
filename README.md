# School Blog API

This is a simple RESTful API for a school blog application built using **FastAPI** and **MongoDB**. The API allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. It uses **Pydantic** for data validation.

## Features

- Create blog posts
- Retrieve blog posts by ID
- Update existing blog posts
- Delete blog posts

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Motor**: An asynchronous MongoDB driver for Python.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing blog post data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- MongoDB installed and running locally

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/school-blog-api.git
   cd school-blog-api
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the MongoDB server (if not already running).

### Running the API

Run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:

```bash
